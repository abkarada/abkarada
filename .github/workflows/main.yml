It uses GitHub Actions to build and update a user's contribution graph, and then has a snake eat all your contributions. The output generates a gif file, that you can then show on your GitHub Profile README. I thought this was pretty cool, so I set about adding this to my profile.

Step 1. Setting up GitHub Actions
The first thing you want to ensure before you start this project, is that you have GitHub Actions setup. Head to your Profile and ensure the "Actions" tab is available. Everyone should now have this feature.

Actions Button

Next, head to Platane's Action (available on the Marketplace) and make a copy of the code. You'll need to add this snippet into your Actions file.

Step 2. Creating your GitHub Actions yaml file
This is definitely the part where I got stuck. When looking at the code, I wasn't sure exactly where to add the lines of code mentioned on Marketplace.

After looking at the way Platane had their Actions file setup, I was able to generate the code (with a little help from Bdougie of course).

I've added the full code snippet below and added plenty of comments to (hopefully make it easy to understand).

You can copy this code straight into a blank *.yml file. Make sure you create a new *.yml file under the following directory:

YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --> .github --> workflows --> FILE_NAME.yml


# GitHub Action for generating a contribution graph with a snake eating your contributions.

name: Generate Snake

# Controls when the action will run. This action runs every 6 hours.
